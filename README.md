## Requirements

* An active Sendbird application with at least two users. See [this introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCS0eyO2Q3U) for instructions on how to create a new application and users.

* See the official [Sendbird UIKit for iOS](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-uikit-ios-sources) repo for current Xcode and iOS version requirements and instructions for adding the SDK dependency.

<br />

## Getting started

This sample consists of the following:

* Initializing and connecting to Sendbird 
* Presenting an instance of SBUChannelListViewController to display a list of available channels, creating and deleting channels, sending and/or editing messages in a channel.

To run:

1. Either download or clone this repository
1. Open the `ContentView.swift` file in XCode
1. Replace the application and user id with your [Sendbird application](https://dashboard.sendbird.com/) information
1. Build & run to a device or simulator.
